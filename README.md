# Heart Attack Prediction
In this project, I had to work on a dataset which consisted of information regarding patients with unstable heart or blood pressure.
I had to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient was likely to get a heart attack in the future or not based on his/her medication and other features.
The data needed to be preprocessed before the machine learning models were applied. The null values were removed on the basis of categorical or continuous data.
In case of continuous columns, the missing values were replace by mean, and for categorical columns, median was used.
Since the machine learning algorithms deal with numbers only, the categorical columns were mapped to numbers using Sci-kit preprocessing.
After preprocessing, I used various machine learning algorithms and used majority voting to predict the label.
The notebook provided consists of the graphical visualizations that show the performance of various models.
